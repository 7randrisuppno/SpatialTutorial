The torrent file contains the compressed archive of the Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition files, which you need to extract later.
 
## Step 2: Prepare Your USB Drive
 
The next thing you need is a high-speed USB drive or stick with at least 8 GB of storage space for the 32-bit edition or 16 GB for the 64-bit edition. You also need to format your USB drive as NTFS with 4k cluster size, which can be done using Windows Disk Management or a third-party tool like MiniTool Partition Wizard. Make sure you back up any important data on your USB drive before formatting it, as all data will be erased.
 
## Step 3: Extract and Install Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition
 
After downloading and formatting your USB drive, you need to extract the archive of the Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition files to a different location than your USB drive, such as your desktop. You can use WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract the archive. Then, you need to run the installer.bat file as administrator and follow the on-screen instructions. The installer will copy the necessary files to your USB drive and make it bootable.
 
## Step 4: Boot and Run Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition
 
Now you are ready to boot and run Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition on any computer that supports booting from USB. To do so, you need to insert your USB drive into the computer, restart it and press a key to access the boot menu. The key may vary depending on your hardware, but it is usually F8, F9, F11, F12 or Option. From the boot menu, choose your USB drive and wait for Windows 7 to load. You can also change the boot order in the BIOS settings if you want to make your USB drive the default boot device.
 
Congratulations! You have successfully installed and booted Windows 7 Ultimate USB Stick Edition on your USB drive.
